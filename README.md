# 🌸 Iris Species Classifier

This project is a machine learning application to classify iris flower species based on their measurements. It uses a **Random Forest classifier** to predict the species of the flower and is built using **Python**, **scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit** for interactive use.

## 🚀 Features
- **Train and Predict**: Train the model or use the pre-trained one to predict species.
- **Web Interface**: A simple web-based UI built with **Streamlit** where users can input measurements and get predictions.
- **Model Retraining**: Allows retraining of the model directly from the app.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Python**: The programming language used.
- **scikit-learn**: For building and training the machine learning model.
- **Streamlit**: For the interactive web interface.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation.
